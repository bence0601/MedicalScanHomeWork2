## Disclaimer: I haven't finished the project, due to the expiration of the suggested time limit. As I previously mentioned and as you can see in my CV, I am familiar with and have experience with the .NET framework and React.js. I would be able to implement what you have requested with the help of React, but have no experience with Angular. In your job description, you also mention that someone would fit your position if they have either Angular or .NET knowledge. Based on this, I fit the second category and that was the reason why I applied.  I would really like to work for your company, and I want to represent my skills in .NET, so if you're still interested in me, and want to see what I'm really capable of, you can interview me in any of the topics mentioned in my resum√©. This time, the 4-hour timeframe you specified for the completion of this task was spent with searching for basic syntax and structure of Angular. If you decide to work with me, I will be open and gladly learn Angular. Despite all this, I managed to implement the logic of the API. It's still not running due to incompatible library versions. I would like to ask you to check the code itself, so you can see what I have managed to accomplish so far.
