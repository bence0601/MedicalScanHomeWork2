## Disclaimer : Haven't finished the project, because of the expiration of the suggested time limit. Also, I would like to kindly draw your attention to the part of my CV which actually matches the job description, which is .NET. I would like to work for your company, and I want to represent my skills in .NET, so if you're still interested in me, and want to see what I'm really capable of, you can interview me in any of the topics mentioned in my resume. Because this 4 hours were really spent with searching for basics syntax and structure of Angular. And however I managed to implement the logic of the API, it's still not running due to incompatible library versions. I would like to ask you for checking the code itself, so you can check what I managed to do so far.
