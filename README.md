## Disclaimer : Haven't finished the project, because the expiration of the suggested time limit. Also, I would like to kindly draw your attention to the part of my CV which actually matches the job description(either .NET or Angular), which is .NET. I would like to work for your company, and I want to represent my skills in .NET, so if you're still interested in me, and want to see original ideas and codes coming from my head, instead of massive google-ing for basic syntax and structure of Angular framework, then send me a homework where you're expecting usage of .NET.
